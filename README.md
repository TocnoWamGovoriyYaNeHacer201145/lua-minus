# A little bit of information
Lua- is a fork of the original [Lua](https://lua.org/) repository but with some changes that look very silly, so Lua- because while you look at the changes you start to lose IQ (just like pressing CTRL+C, CTRL+V). It has some features that are as useless as possible, by the way I noticed that Lua is very popular in the Roblox space, they even have their own fork [Luau](https://luau.org/), so expect a version of it as well.

# What is Lua-
Lua is a programming language that is just a slightly modified Lua with very minimal changes, 
but maybe they will be useful to someone. I originally wanted to make [C--](https://www.cs.tufts.edu/~nr/c--/) but saw that it already exists, so thanks for that (not in a bad light, it's a really good language).

# What it adds
Here are all the additions, not good, not bad.
```
StuckLoop() // Don't add it to the code, there will be bad consequences
RandomSymbols() // A copy of the RandomSymbols function that was in U#
private name = "Ben" // private instead of local, and public instead of global
func greet(name)
  print("Hello, " ..name)
end
```
