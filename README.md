# Lua-
Lua- is a fork of the original [Lua](https://lua.org/) repository but with some changes that look very silly, so Lua- because while you look at the changes you start to lose IQ (just like pressing CTRL+C, CTRL+V). It has some features that are as useless as possible, by the way I noticed that Lua is very popular in the Roblox space, they even have their own fork [Luau](https://luau.org/), so expect a version of it as well.
