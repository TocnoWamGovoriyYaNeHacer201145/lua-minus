# A little bit of information
Lua- is a fork of the original [Lua](https://lua.org/) repository but with some changes that look very silly, so Lua- because while you look at the changes you start to lose IQ (just like pressing CTRL+C, CTRL+V). It has some features that are as useless as possible, by the way I noticed that Lua is very popular in the Roblox space, they even have their own fork [Luau](https://luau.org/), so expect a version of it as well.

# What is Lua-
Lua is a programming language that is just a slightly modified Lua in the lbaselib.c file, these changes are very minimal, 
but maybe they will be useful to someone. I originally wanted to make [C--](https://www.cs.tufts.edu/~nr/c--/) but saw that it already exists, so thanks for that (not in a bad light, it's a really good language).

# What it adds
Here are all the additions (it's better to stop reading the additions here, otherwise the 10 IQ of your brain will simply evaporate)
```
ReturnZero() # Returns zero
ReturnOne() # Returns one
StuckLoop() # Don't add it to the code, there will be bad consequences
ReturnNULL() # Returns NULL (or nil in lua)
RandomSymbols() # A copy of the RandomSymbols function that was in U#
show("Bye, world?") # show instead of print, because... Moon is Moon and Earth is Earth
```
